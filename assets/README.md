The sprite assets are from [Shaun Spaulding's action RPG tutorial](https://shaunjs.itch.io/shauns-action-rpg-tutorial); to the best of my knowledge, I don't have a license to redistribute them or publish a game that uses them, and neither do you. In this project, I'm using them in the spirit of their stated purpose: to learn some game development stuff and get comfortable with an engine.

The fonts I [bought from Daniel Linssen](https://managore.itch.io/) and are licensed as free to use with attribution.
